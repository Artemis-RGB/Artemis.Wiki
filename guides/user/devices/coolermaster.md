# Introduction
![cooler-master-logo.svg](/vendors/cooler-master-logo.svg){.align-abstopright}Artemis supports Cooler Master RGB products through the official Cooler Master SDK.

# Requirements
The SDK is included with Artemis so Cooler Master is one of the few vendors that requires no extra software, kudos to them. :)

# Troubleshooting
If your device is supported by the SDK but does not show up in Artemis, it means we need to update our hardware mappings in order to support it.

Either create an issue [here](https://github.com/Artemis-RGB/Artemis.Plugins/issues) and include your logs (GitHub account required) or contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/S3MVaC9) in the `#plugins` channel.

# Supported devices
Artemis can support any device supported by the Cooler Master SDK but in order to identify which device is which, we need a `PID` which is an ID unique to Cooler Master products.
