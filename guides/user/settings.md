# Settings
The settings page lets you manage application settings, plugins and devices. 

## General

In this tab you can manage application settings. Each setting comes with a short explaination. Any changes you make here are saved automatically.

## Plugins

This tab contains all your plugins. Right now with the absence of the workshop you cannot install/remove plugins but you can disable them.

Some plugins have extra settings, they can be accessed from here by clicking the **Settings** button on the respective plugin.
If a plugin failed to load, you can click on the red **Load failed** button to view the error.

Plugins and their functionality is further explained in the [plugins guide](/guides/user/plugins).

## Devices

This tab contains all devices detected by Artemis.  
Clicking **Identify** will make the device blink white a few times, that way you can tell the difference between similar devices.
If you press the three-dots button, you can open a the device properties dialog. For more info on device properties check out the [devices guide](/guides/user/device).
