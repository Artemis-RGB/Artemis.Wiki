The Artemis Workshop is *the* place to share and find awesome creations.
The Workshop is a continiously evolving feature in which we're hoping to fill the gap between users and content creators.

# Using the Workshop
Everything workshop related happens inside the Artemis desktop application. 

To access the workshop, simply click on the Workshop menu entry in the sidebar. From there you'll be taken to the welcome screen where you can navigate to different parts of the workshop.

When you've found something you like you can download the latest release, it'll automatically be installed for you.

## Available Content
At the time of writing you're only able to submit and download profiles. Other kinds of submissions such as device layouts and plugins are planned.

> While we'll try our best to moderate what's on the workshop, we cannot be held accountable for workshop contents.
You are ofcourse always welcome to report innapropriate entries to us.

## Becoming a Content Creator
Anyone can add their submissions to the workshop and thereby become a creator.  All you have to do is create an account in Artemis and you're good to go!
We're hoping to see many of you add their own unique submissions :)

**We do have some rules for what kind of content is accepted, in short:**
- No explicit/sexual or any other 18+ content is allowed
- No (links to) piracy or any other illigal activities
- In the end, we're the main judge and can decide whether or not something is appropriate for the workshop.


# Future Plans
The workshop is an evolving feature and we've left some things open to be decided based on user feedback and how things turn out over time. However, here are some of the things that are already planned.

## Different kinds of content
We're planning to add support for more kinds of content as we go along.

### Device layouts
The idea here is that users can submit new layouts of their devices so that Artemis can (perhaps automatically) download them for other users.

Ideally when uploading a layout you can select which brand and model(s) your layout fits. That way it should be a breeze for new users to get their devices looking good and working well.

Eventually this'll also mean layouts no longer need to be bundled with plugins.


### Plugins
Plugins are a major part of Artemis and we want the workshop to be the main distribution platform for them. Due to how powerful plugins are - they can basically do anything a locally running program can do - we're waiting with plugins to gain some experience in running the workshop.
