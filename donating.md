# Why consider donating
As with many free software Artemis offers the option of donating some of your funds towards development. Working on Artemis has so far taken thousands of hours of my free time and I expect nothing in return from anyone, I enjoy coding after all and it's a hobby project.

Still, there are a few simple reasons why I accept donations
1. Artemis costs me money. I'm paying for a server that hosts this very wiki, the website and in the future the worksop.
2. With donations I will invest in RGB hardware, allowing me to keep existing device providers up-to-date and work on new ones.
3. It's simply nice to see a small reward for my work.

# Donation options
I have set up a GitHub sponsorship in which you can chose to sponsor me with a recurring payment (you can cancel at any time)

If you'd rather make a one-time donation, you can do so via PayPal

Everything and anything is appreciated! :)


# Donation rewards
I'm giving those who decide to use GitHub sponsorship a special Sponsor role on Discord ðŸ˜Š.
In the future I'm considering setting up a Patreon with some more tangible rewards. 
I might offer some extra features such as cloud backup of profiles or custom app color scemes but I will never limit Artemis's regular functionality for non-donators.

If you have suggestions, I am open to them!
