## Work in progress screenshots
**Note:** Video tutorials and written guides on many of the features displayed below are planned for when Artemis 2 nears feature-completion.

![plugins.png](/screenshots/plugins.png){.radius-5 .elevation-3}
*Artemis 2 has been build from the ground up with modularity in mind. This means almost everything can be extended using plugins. New devices, effects, games and almost everything else can be added through plugins.*

![Surface editor](/screenshots/surface-editor.png){.radius-5 .elevation-3}
*The surface editor allows you to recreate your desktop in 2D space, this provides Artemis with spatial awareness and ensures effects scale properly over your different devices. Right clicking a device lets you change its properties such as rotation and scale.*

![shapes.png](/screenshots/profile-editor.png){.radius-5 .elevation-3}
*Here is an overview of the profile editor. While it may be overwhelming at first it is very simple to get some basic effects set up. When you're ready, the profile editor will allow you to create almost anything you can think of.*

![led-selection.png](/screenshots/led-selection.png){.radius-5 .elevation-3}
*Layers are created by making a selection of LEDs, this allows you to precisely dictate where a layer may render.*

![shapes.png](/screenshots/shapes.png){.radius-5 .elevation-3}
*Inside the layer you can freely manipulate the shape that is being rendered. By default it always fills the entire layer as seen in the previous screenshot, but it can shrink and even be a circle, revealing the rainbow background behind.*

*With the keyframe engine you can animate almost any property of the layer. In the example above the position and scale of the shape have been animated using keyframes.*

![Nodes](/screenshots/nodes.png){.radius-5 .elevation-3}
*Using visual programming you can create conditions to dictate when a layer may show. The data available to these conditions is provided by plugins, allowing easy expansion.*
